# Inequality and Self-Esteem

This repository contains the Stata code, project structure, and documentation for the project "Inequality and Self-Esteem". The goal is to study how inequality measures relate to self-esteem outcomes across countries.

## Project structure

- `src/`  
  Stata `.do` scripts. These clean raw data, construct analysis datasets, run regressions, and generate tables/figures.

- `data/raw/`  
  Raw source data files (not included in the repo). See `docs/README_data.md` for how to obtain them.

- `data/processed/`  
  Clean / merged / analysis-ready data generated by the scripts.

- `outputs/`  
  Regression tables, figures, and other final artifacts produced by the analysis.

- `docs/`  
  Documentation, including data availability and replication notes.

- `run_all.do`  
  Master script that runs the full pipeline in order (import → clean → analyze → export).

- `requirements.do`  
  Declares Stata version, required user-written packages, seeds, etc.

## How to reproduce the analysis

1. Get the raw data:
   - See `docs/README_data.md` for instructions on obtaining V-Dem, WVS, SWIID, etc.
   - Put the downloaded files in `data/raw/` using the same filenames described there.

2. Open Stata and set the project path:
   - Edit the `global PROJECT` line at the top of `run_all.do` so it matches the path on your machine.

3. Run in Stata:
   ```stata
   do requirements.do
   do run_all.do
